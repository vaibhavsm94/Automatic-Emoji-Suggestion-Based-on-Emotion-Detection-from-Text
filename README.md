# Automatic-Emoji-Suggestion-Based-on-Emotion-Detection-from-Text
- Created an application which obtains user text as input and is processed by model based on Natural Language Processing to classify text into one of seven emotions: Joy, Sad, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame and Guilt, and recommend set of emoji based on emotion. 
- Applied n-gram technique using Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, also came up with a Hybrid Model that combines both n-gram and bi-gram techniques which optimized the model. 
- Adopted ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions) Dataset with more than 7500 samples.
